## Description

An interactive web-based tool for exploring how floating-point numbers are represented in binary. It visualizes the IEEE 754 standard and related formats, letting you enter values and immediately see their underlying bit patterns. You can directly manipulate the sign, exponent and significand fields and observe how changes affect the stored value. This tool helps learners and developers experiment with precision limits, rounding and common pitfalls of floating-point arithmetic. It supports common formats such as half (16-bit), single (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) as well as custom configurations with adjustable exponent and significand sizes.
